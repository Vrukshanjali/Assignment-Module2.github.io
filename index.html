                    <h3 id="sec1">Sushi</h3>
                    <p>Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Sushi is a very healthy meal! It's a good source of heart healthy omega-3 fatty acids thanks to the fish it's made with. Sushi is also low in calories – there's no added fat. The most common type is nigiri sushi – fingers of sticky rice topped with a small filet of fish or seafood. </p>

                    <p>Beef is meat from a cow. It's also a word for a complaint. If you have a beef with someone, you're not sharing a steak, you have a gripe... The word beef comes from the Old French word buef, which became the word for basically, cow meat. Beef is to cow as pork is to pig or mutton is to sheep. </p>

                    <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world, and was one of the first domesticated animals. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.</p>
